# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide is meant to help student coders quickly access very basic information about different aspects of beginning coding on their path to completing their bootcamp. The guide includes notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. 

This application features very basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though it does include several slightly more advanced components like child combinators in CSS and unique background colors using the ID attribute.
